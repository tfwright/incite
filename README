=== Overview

CiteMe is an academic citation library that lets you easily define objects for typical academic sources (eg. books, articles) which can be used to output formatted html for a variety of bibliographical formats (eg. Chicago Manual of Style, MLA).  Right now only CMS is supported.

CiteMe is in alpha alpha stage.  It's useless, don't install it.

=== Usage

* Note: This syntax is very experimental, and will likely--no, definitely--change in a radical way (see above).

irb> require 'lib/citeme'
=> true

First you need to instantiate a source you want to cite:

irb> source = CiteMe::Source.new
=> #<CiteMe::Source:0x8c5f0>

Sources don't require any parameters to be created, but obviously you're not going to get a very useful citation:

irb> source.citation(:Note)
=> ", <em></em> (: , ), ."

So lets add some metadata and try again. When we're talking about citations, proper attribution is usually the most pressing task:

irb> source.authors = ["Some Guy", "Smart Gal"]
=> ["Some Guy", "Smart Gal"]
irb> source.citation(:Note)
=> "Smart Gal and Some Guy, <em></em> (: , ), ."

OK.  That's a little better.  It's even sorted them for you!  Unfortunately...it also spat out a bunch of garbage relating to other unavailable data.  In the future the plan is for CiteMe to be intelligent about how to format 'partial' sources.

=== Other future plans

* Integration with various bibliographies (Google Books, Amazon, &c?)
* Citation text
* Source types
* Minimal validations of metadata
* Different type of formats (to_s, to_rtf)
